# angular2-basic-start
A simple base project for Angular 2 apps, based on latest angular 2 version. Including lite server, file watch and reload.

The project is supposed to be used as a base project to learn angular2. Becasue there is no gulp or webpack to implement the tasks like minify and bundle js files, this repository should not be used in your product development.

## How to use.
Clone the repository, install the dependency and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/lamphc/angular2-base-start.git
cd angular2-basic
npm install
npm start
```
